# Break the Loop - Deep Bug Analysis

When debug is complete, use this for deep analysis to break the "fix bug -> forget -> repeat" cycle.

---

## Analysis Framework

Analyze the bug you just fixed from these 5 dimensions:

### 1. Root Cause Category

Which category does this bug belong to?

| Category | Characteristics | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| **A. Missing Spec** | No documentation on how to do it | New feature without checklist |
| **B. Cross-Layer Contract** | Interface between layers unclear | API returns different format than expected |
| **C. Change Propagation Failure** | Changed one place, missed others | Changed function signature, missed call sites |
| **D. Test Coverage Gap** | Unit test passes, integration fails | Works alone, breaks when combined |
| **E. Implicit Assumption** | Code relies on undocumented assumption | Timestamp seconds vs milliseconds |

### 2. Why Fixes Failed (if applicable)

If you tried multiple fixes before succeeding, analyze each failure:

- **Surface Fix**: Fixed symptom, not root cause
- **Incomplete Scope**: Found root cause, didn't cover all cases
- **Tool Limitation**: grep missed it, type check wasn't strict
- **Mental Model**: Kept looking in same layer, didn't think cross-layer

### 3. Prevention Mechanisms

What mechanisms would prevent this from happening again?

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Documentation** | Write it down so people know | Update thinking guide |
| **Architecture** | Make the error impossible structurally | Type-safe wrappers |
| **Compile-time** | Strict type checking, no escape hatches | Signature change causes compile error |
| **Runtime** | Monitoring, alerts, scans | Detect orphan entities |
| **Test Coverage** | E2E tests, integration tests | Verify full flow |
| **Code Review** | Checklist, PR template | "Did you check X?" |

### 4. Systematic Expansion

What broader problems does this bug reveal?

- **Similar Issues**: Where else might this problem exist?
- **Design Flaw**: Is there a fundamental architecture issue?
- **Process Flaw**: Is there a development process improvement?
- **Knowledge Gap**: Is the team missing some understanding?

### 5. Knowledge Capture

Solidify insights into the system:

- [ ] Update `.trellis/spec/guides/` thinking guides
- [ ] Update relevant `.trellis/spec/` docs
- [ ] Create issue record (if applicable)
- [ ] Create feature ticket for root fix
- [ ] Update check guidelines if needed

## Core Philosophy

> **The value of debugging is not in fixing the bug, but in making this class of bugs never happen again.**

Three levels of insight:
1. **Tactical**: How to fix THIS bug
2. **Strategic**: How to prevent THIS CLASS of bugs
3. **Philosophical**: How to expand thinking patterns

30 minutes of analysis saves 30 hours of future debugging.

## Thinking Framework: Bayesian Reasoning

When multiple root causes are plausible and evidence is incomplete, update your beliefs proportionally to new evidence rather than clinging to initial assumptions.

### Step 1: Establish Priors

Before investigating, state what you believe and why:

List plausible hypotheses with current supporting and contradicting evidence, uncertainty and a discriminating check. Qualitative confidence is sufficient; do not invent numeric probabilities or require them to sum to 100%.

### Step 2: Observe Evidence

Document what you found — be specific about reliability:

- What exactly did you observe?
- How reliable? (test output > log message > user report > hunch)
- Could multiple hypotheses explain this?

### Step 3: Update Beliefs

For each hypothesis, ask: **How likely is this evidence if this hypothesis were true?**

Direction of update matters more than calculation:
- Evidence strongly predicted by H1 → H1 probability increases
- Evidence contradicts H2 → H2 probability decreases
- Evidence equally likely under all → no update

### Step 4: Seek Discriminating Evidence

Don't gather more of the same. Find evidence that **differs strongly** between top hypotheses.

> If H1 and H3 are close: "What would I see if H1 is true but not if H3 is true?" Then check for that.

### Step 5: State Confidence

State which hypothesis the evidence supports, what it rules out, and which limits remain. Choose the next check or authorized fix based on consequences and uncertainty, not a numeric threshold. Do not add speculative fallbacks to compensate for an unverified cause.

Never express binary certainty when evidence is incomplete. Use "most likely", "plausible but unlikely", "worth investigating".

### Common Fallacies

| Fallacy | Example | Correction |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Base rate neglect** | "Test failed → code is broken" | How often do tests fail for other reasons? |
| **Confirmation bias** | "Must be a race condition, let me find race evidence" | Actively seek evidence AGAINST your top hypothesis |
| **Anchoring** | "Last time it was caching, probably caching again" | Establish priors from current context, not yesterday's bug |

## After Analysis: Immediate Actions

After analysis, preserve the reusable finding at its natural owner:

1. **Update applicable spec/guides** when the finding establishes a reusable executable contract or thinking trigger within the task's authority:
   - If it's a cross-platform issue → update `cross-platform-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's a cross-layer issue → update `cross-layer-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's a code reuse issue → update `code-reuse-thinking-guide.md`
   - If it's domain-specific → update `backend/*.md` or `frontend/*.md`

2. **Respect the source owner** — project specs do not automatically belong in Trellis's bundled templates. Update a component template only when that component owns the rule and the task authorizes that source change; use its native generation path for installed assets.

3. **Record evidence and verification** in the current task or journal when no reusable spec change is justified. Commit only under the project's existing authorization; analysis does not grant commit, publication or installation authority.

Keep the finding discoverable without manufacturing a spec change or a second task ledger.
