description: "Resume work on the current task. Loads the workflow Phase Index, figures out which phase/step to pick up at, then pulls the step-level detail via get_context.py --mode phase. Use when coming back to an in-progress task and you need to know what to do next."

# Continue Current Task

Resume from the active Trellis task and its current phase. The task record and phase route are authoritative; do not infer the phase from artifact presence or session history.

## Load current context

    python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py

## Read the phase route

    python3 ./.trellis/scripts/get_context.py --mode phase

Follow the active phase breadcrumb to the matching bundled phase Skill and its workflow.md. Use the task CLI to inspect or change phase state. A resume does not itself accept an artifact, grant authorization, or move the task.

Without hook context, use `python3 ./.trellis/scripts/task.py phase show <task>`
and explicitly read the applicable spec indexes and guidelines. If the route is
missing, inspect recorded requirements and authorization, choose the ordered
phases with evidence for omissions, then initialize through the native CLI.
Reuse existing confirmations; resume only the known unfinished action.

Task lifecycle status and business phase are separate. A planning task may remain in Goal Exploration and Requirements Confirmation Phase, Decision Space Construction and Consolidation Phase, or Solution Design and Convergence Phase. `in_progress` marks authorized Task Implementation and Test Verification Phase; `completed` and `cancelled` are terminal lifecycle states. Delivery Review and On-Site Closeout Phase remains explicit.

## Phase operations

Resume the known unfinished action first. Reassess auxiliary methods only when the problem, phase, or available capabilities have changed; reuse still-valid Skill bodies and decisions. Select relevant host-declared methods directly, or use an available workflow router for unclear combinations. Do not restart discovery, preload a collection, infer paths from old summaries, or repeat settled questions. Auxiliary methods do not change task state or action permissions.

Use the native task CLI for phase artifact revisions, acceptance, evidence-backed skips, waiting, blocking, resuming, returning to an earlier phase, route changes, implementation authorization, completion, and cancellation. Read task.py help for current arguments. Do not create a second status record or use formal session handoff to resume task work.
